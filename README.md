# Investigate-No-Shows-in-Brazilian-Medical-Appointments
Udacity Course Project

A person makes a medical appointment but no show. This activity is quite common in Brazil and it wastes large amount of social and medical resources. For certain groups of people, the no-show rate can be up to 27%. To change this disastrous situation, dataset was collected and analysis was carried out to answer the research question that what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for his/her scheduled appointment.

In this project, information from 100K medical appointments in Brazil were collected and was focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointments. A number of characteristics about the patients are included in each row:

'ScheduleDay' tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment;
'Neighborhood' indicates the location of the hospital;
'Scholarship' indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program;
Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says 'No' if the patient showed up to their appointment, and 'Yes' if they did not show up.
